The Resourceful Embedded Circuity Kit Printed Circuit Board Assembly (RECK PCBA) is a custom board talored to teach new Peer Instructors (PIs) all of the basic and advanced embedded use cases seen in the HIVE Makerspace.

Integrates a microcontroller, probe-able SPI, I2C, UART, motor drivers, servo drivers, power electronics, and commonly used sensors.

### Basic Embedded:
- ESP32-S3 (Microcontroller Hardware/Software Control Flow)
- Pushbuttons (Digital Input)
- Single LEDs (Digital Output)
- Photoresistor (Analog Input)
- Potentiometer (Analog Input)
- Analog-to-Digital Converter (Internal ADC; Read Analog Signals)
- Magnetic Buzzer (Audio Ouput)
- Voltage Translation (Level Shifting)
  
### Advanced Embedded:
- IMU (SPI Interface)
- Barometric Pressure and Humidity Sensor (SPI Interface)
- IR Ranging Sensor (I2C Interface)
- Digital-to-Analog Converter (I2C Interface; Output Analog Signals)
- Servos (PWM Interface)
- DC Brushed Motors (PWM Interface)
- Chained LEDs (PWM Interface)
